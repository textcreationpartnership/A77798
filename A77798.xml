            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It hath been ever the humour of my <hi>Genius</hi> to put me upon untrodden Pathes, and to make up aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate Bodies of very ſcarce and wide diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Notions; which had been more eaſie for the Faculty of my weak Body, had I had a Signality of Spirit to ſummon De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocriticall Atomes to conglobate into an intellectuall Forme; or, that <hi>Mercury</hi> had been ſo propitious a Lord of the Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in my Nativity, as he was in <hi>Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on's,</hi> and beſtowed ſome <hi>Orpharion</hi> upon me, with whoſe ſound I might have attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
<pb facs="tcp:114623:7"/>
Notions, and made them come dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to the Conſtruction of a Book What I here preſent you with, is an <hi>Enditement</hi> fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med againſt moſt of the Nations under the Sun; whereby they are <hi>arraigned</hi> at the Tribunall of Nature, as guilty of High-treaſon, in Abaſing, Counterfeiting, Defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, and Clipping her Coine, inſtampt with her Image and Superſcription on the Body of Man. The <hi>matter</hi> of <hi>Fact</hi> is proved by ſufficient <hi>Witneſſes</hi> of credible <hi>Hiſtorians,</hi> that it will not be an eaſie thing for them to <hi>traverſe the Inditement.</hi> The Proſecution of ſuch an Action, wherein the honour and reputation of the great Architect, man's <hi>Protoplaſtes,</hi> is ſo much concern'd, had been (I humbly confeſs) more fit for one who had deſerved to be <hi>Atturney Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall</hi> to Nature, then for me, the meaneſt <hi>Solicitor</hi> in her Court. When you have well viewed the <hi>Scenes</hi> and Devilliſh ſhapes of this <hi>Practicall Metamorphoſis,</hi> and ſcan'd them in your ſerious thoughts, you will wonder at their audacious phant'ſies, who ſeeme to hold <hi>Specificall deformities,</hi> or that any part can ſeeme unhandſome in
<pb facs="tcp:114623:8"/>
their Eyes, which hath appeared good and beautifull unto their <hi>Maker:</hi> And I doubt not but you will ſoone diſcerne the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe malice of Satan in it, tempting man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to a corporall Apoſtacy from himſelf: as if in an Apiſh deſpight of the glory of mans Creation, that divine conſultation, <hi>Eaciamus hominem,</hi> Let <hi>us</hi> make man accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our Image; He would have his <hi>Defaciamus hominem,</hi> Let us deface man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our likeneſſe; inſomuch as that of the <hi>Pſalmiſt, I am fearfully and wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made,</hi> might be ironically applyed to man in this his <hi>abuſive Transformation.</hi> Beſides what in the <hi>Inditement</hi> I have charged upon the ſcore of mans pragmaticall invention, (which is the maine Deſigne) upon ſtrict Diſquiſition after the cauſes and original of theſe Monſtroſities, which I had rather call Native then Naturall; I lay them to the charge of man, diſcharging Nature from having any hand, or the leaſt intention ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. And concerning National Monſtroſities, I account it a high ſlander raiſed againſt the Honeſty of Nature, that ſhe ſhould be delighted to diſport her ſelfe with ſuch An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick

varieties of formes as appeare in the world, or ſhould ſometimes ſet her ſelfe to mock any Perſon, much leſſe whole Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, out of their right ſhape and feature; ſo that you will clearely ſee here, as in the mirrour of <hi>Alitophilus,</hi> the true cauſes and effects of all the Artificiall Retortions, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Alienations, and Abſurd Transfigurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Humane forme. Why I dedicate this to you, is not ſolemnly to engage you to a Polemicall Defence of it; but only, if need be, to witneſſe my good intention and zeale to <hi>Nature</hi> (whether it be accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to knowledge, let others judge) and that this may remaine as a Pledge of our contracted Friendſhip and Amity; and that Poſterity and Future Ages may know in the Religion thereof,</p>

            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Alen,</hi> to convince the errour of <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus,</hi> ſaid he would give him an hundred yeares to alter or change the ſcituation, figure, or Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of any one part of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Fabrick; and he did not doubt, but it would come to paſſe in the end, that he would be forced to confeſſe, that the ſame could by no meanes have beene made after any other or more perfect manner.<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Crook</hi> in his Microcoſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphia.</note> A modern Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomiſt ſpeakes a little more boldly, affirming, that if all the Angels ſhould have ſpent a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years in the framing and making of man, they could not have caſt him into ſo curious a mould or made him like to that he is, much leſſe could they have ſet him forth in any better man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. For, God hath wonderfully, and moſt arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially framed the body of man. The excellency wherof is ſuch, that the Anthropomorphites held that God had ſuch a Body, and that ours was but the Copie of his, becauſe they knew God to be moſt excellent, they attributed to him ſuch a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. And the Philoſophers were ſo raviſhed with the conſideration of it, that <hi>Zoroaſter</hi> cries out, as if Nature had undertaken a bold piece of worke when ſhe made man, and <hi>Euripides</hi> ſaith
<pb facs="tcp:114623:24"/>
that man is a moſt beautifull Creature, framed by a moſt wiſe Artiſan. The Spirit of God ſpeaks admirably of the Body of man in Scripture,<note place="margin">David <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39 ver. 15.</note> for, <hi>David</hi> ſaith, that his Body was curiouſly wrought in his Mothers womb as a piece of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidery or Needle-work, as the Hebrew word (rukkanthi) ſignifies: <hi>Genebrard</hi> renders the word in the <hi>Pſalme, variè contextus ſum, &amp; diverſificatus. Pelicanus, artificioſe concinnatus ſum,</hi> that is, with ſingular variety, and moſt artificially faſhioned.</p>
            <p>Yet the blind impiety of ſome hath led them to ſuch a height of preſumption, as to finde fault with many parts of this curious Fabricke, and to queſtion the wiſdome of <hi>God</hi> in the contrivance thereof, upon ſuch Blaſphemous fancies men have taken upon them an audacious Art to forme and new ſhape themſelves, altering the humane Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, and moulding it according to their own will and arbitrement, varying it after a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full manner, almoſt every Nation having a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular whimzy as touching corporall faſhions of their own invention. In which kind of mutations, they do ſchematize or change the organicall parts of their bodies into diverſe depraved Figures. <hi>Cardan</hi> ſpeaking of ſuch outlandiſh faſhion-mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,<note place="margin">Cardan de re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum varietate lib. <hi>8.</hi> cap. <hi>13.</hi>
               </note> ſaith, it appears that the humane forme hath bin varyed many waies, both by Art and Diurnall ſucceſſion; but whatſoever is done againſt the decree of Nature, is noxious and inconvenient for the body: yet they who practiſe this Art, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that they become thereby more healthfull, ſtrong and gallant. But the Midwife ought to reduce to the naturall ſtate, and not to draw and
<pb facs="tcp:114623:24"/>

And theſe crimes both of commiſſion &amp; omiſſion, committed by Midwives and Nurſes ſo frequently in theſe times againſt the tender bodies of Infants, appear more notorious, if we reflect upon the carefull practiſe of ancient times in this matter of high concernment: for it ſhould appeare by a paſſage of <hi>Plato,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Plato</hi> in Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biade.</note> that the Nutritii of old, whileſt the bodies of Infants were tender, did conform them moſt to the advantage of Nature, which is the office of Coſmeticall Phyſick; not as ſome falſly ſuppoſe, only to provide fucus's to diſguiſe the naturall, and that way only to palliate the defects of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Coſmetique is the exornatorie part of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, whoſe Office is, that whatſoever is according to Nature, that it is to preſerve in the Body, and ſo conſequently to cheriſh and maintaine the native Beautie thereof.

<pb facs="tcp:114623:26"/>
and all the inward parts are the very ſame that ours, as if they were made juſt by one pattern. Yet they a little differ from us in the Feet; for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what long they are like as their hands be, and the ſole of their Foot is anſwerable to the palm of their hand. Their nailes are channelled halfe round like a gutter tile: whereas in man they be flat and broad. And <hi>Galen,</hi> who was a great diſſecter of Apes, and therein acknowleged the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance to man, yet obſerves that the Thumb of an Ape differs much from that of a man. But by this new Hiſtory of abuſed Nature it will appeare a ſad truth, that mans indeavours have runn the clean contrary courſe, and he hath been ſo farr from raiſing himſelfe above the pitch of his Originall endowments, that he is much fallen below himſelfe; and in many parts of the world is practically degenerated into the ſimilitude of a Beaſt. The danger of man ſince his fall is more in ſinking downe then in climbing up, in dejecting then in raiſing himſelfe to a better condition or improvement of naturall parts. It is a ſad thing (as a grave divine ſaith) to conſider the proneneſſe of man to ſuch a deſcent,<note place="margin">Dr. Donne.</note> ſuch a dejection and ſuch a diminution of himſelfe, a deſcent generally into a lower nature being forbidden by <hi>GOD</hi> with <hi>Nolite fieri,</hi>

The firſt ſin that ever was, was an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending, a climbing too high, and man in the ſecone place was overthrown by the ſame affectation: but it ſeems this fall hath broke the neck of mans Ambition, and now wee dare not be ſo like God as we ſhould be; Ever ſince this fall Man is ſo farr from affecting higher places then his Nature is capable of, that he is ſtill groveling upon the ground, and participates, and imitates, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes more of the nature of the beaſt then of his own.

But of man it ſeems, God was diſtruſtfull from the begining, he did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce upon Mans Creation that he was good, becauſe his goodneſſe was a contingent thing, and conſiſted in the future uſe of his free will: for, that facultie and power of the will is <hi>virtus trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formativa,</hi> by it we change our ſelves into that we love moſt, and we are come to love thoſe things moſt which are below us. <hi>Vive juxta genus tuum</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> to man, live according to thy kind, <hi>Non adulteres genus tuum,</hi> doe not abuſe, doe not allay, doe not abaſtardiſe that Noble kind, that Noble nature that God hath impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to thee, imprinted in thee.

deface that leafe in which the Authors picture, the image of God is expreſſed, as in man. All o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creatures keep their ranks, their places and natures in the world, onely man himſelfe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders all, and that by diſplacing himſelfe, by loſing his place. While wee diſpute in Schooles whether if it were poſſible for Man to doe ſo, it were lawfull for him to deſtroy any one ſpecies of Gods creatures, though it were but the ſpecies of Toades and Spiders (becauſe this were a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away one linke of Gods chaine, one note of his harmony) wee have taken away that which is the jewell at that chaine, that which is the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of the ſong, inſomuch that wee are not only inferiour to the beaſts, but wee are our ſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come beaſts, a moſt lamentable deſcent; that as God ſaid in the beginning, in contempt and in deriſion, behold man is become as one of us: ſo now (as St. <hi>Bernard</hi> makes the note) the Horſe and Mule may ſay, <hi>quaſi unus ex nobis,</hi> behold man is become as one of us, inſomuch as if the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rective part of Phyſick were utterly unknown in the world, and the friendly offices it might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme to Nature were quite excluded the uſe of Man, and no care continued to prevent the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Nationall monſtroſities (without more reſtraining grace) the vanity of man blowne upon by the ſuggeſtions of the Enemy of Mankind, would enforce and propagate ſo many corporall Errata's in every Region, that the humane Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure would be ſo depraved, that (in time) the true ſhape of man would be unknown, or loſt in an injurious crowd of deformities: and although in
<pb facs="tcp:114623:27"/>
theſe parts of the chriſtian world (we might think) there needed not ſo great a Damme to be made againſt the inundation of this miſchiefe: yet if we conſider how guilty the moſt civiliz'd Nations are of tampering with the Body to the deforming of it, and to the prejudice of Natures operations, and withall what fooliſh affectations in veſts we have, wherein we ſeem to vie deformities with the moſt Barbarous Nations; ſo approving their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected ſhapes, that wee are in a manner unciviliz'd by them, wee may juſtly doubt whether this, by the juſt judgment of God may not in time reduce us to our firſt Barbariſme, and ſo conſequently expoſe us to all the deformities and practicall affectations, which can proceed from a depraved imagination. For the better prevention of which evils, in the behalfe of Nature, whoſe vindication I have here undertaken, and for the Honour of Phyſitians who profeſſe themſelves the friends of Nature and to be her faithfull ſervants, I could wiſh that this reproach that lies upon them might be taken away by the promoting and reviving of this Noble part of Coſmetiques, for the better eſtabliſhing and preſervation of the honeſty of the Humane Fabrique, and the regular beauty of the Body.

As for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; the Head in other Creatures is formed after a Triangular manner, and whereas it ought to be round in Man, theſe Nations diſtending the orbicularity of their Heads, change it into an Angular Body, thereby, to the great affront of Nature and abaſement of the Humane Forme, maintaining a greater Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie between them and bruits then ever ſhe intended.

ſaith he are a ſtrange headleſſe Nation, for on the Banks of the River <hi>Caora</hi> are a Nation of People, whoſe Heads appeare not above their Shoulders, which though it may be thought a meere Fable, yet for my own part I am reſolved it is true; becauſe every Child in the Province of <hi>Arromaia</hi> and <hi>Comurs</hi> affirme all the ſame: they are call'd <hi>Ewaipanomi,</hi> &amp; are reported to have their Eyes in their Shoulders, and their Mouths in the Middle of their Breaſts, and that a long traine of haire groweth backward between the Shoulders. The Son of <hi>Tomawari,</hi> which I brought with me into England, told me, that they were the moſt mighty Men of all the Land, and uſe Bowes, Arrowes, and Clubs, thrice as bigg as any of <hi>Guiana,</hi> or of the <hi>Oronoqueponi,</hi> and that one of the <hi>Iwarawakeri,</hi> tooke a Priſoner of them the Yeare before our arrivall there, and brought him into the Borders of <hi>Aromaia</hi> his Fathers Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. And further when I ſeemed to doubt of it, he told me that it was no wonder among them, but that they were as great a Nation, and as common as any other in all the Provinces, and had of late Years ſlain many hundreds of his Fathers People, and of other Nations their Neighbours; but it was not my chance to heare of them, till I was come away, and if I had but ſpoken one word of it while I was there, I might have brought one of them with me, to put the matter out of doubt. Such a Nation was written of by <hi>Mandevill,</hi> whoſe reports were held for Fables many Years; and yet ſince the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> were diſcovered, we find his relation true of ſuch things as heretofore
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:114623:39"/>
wee held incredible; whether it be true or no, the matter is not great, neither can there be any profit in the imagination; for my own part, I ſaw them not, but I am reſolved that ſo many People did not all combine, or fore-think to make the report. The Tranſlator of the Hiſtory of <hi>Congo</hi> written by <hi>Pigafetta</hi> hopes, that in time, ſome good <hi>Guianean</hi> will make good proofe to our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, that there are this day headleſſe Men.

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:114623:40"/>
mankind, but all other Creatures were produced from the tabid Carcaſſes by the Celeſtiall influx without ſeed; which is a thing no wiſe man can be brought to believe, that ſo Noble a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhould ariſe out of a putrid matter, about whoſe Creation the whole Godhead was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, wherefore ſo great and Beautifull a worke that was worthy of the Divine Labour, could not ſpontaneouſly proceed, it being moſt unlikely that Man being <hi>Compos mentis,</hi> which is a particle of Divinitie, ſhould reſult from ſo vile an originall.<note place="margin">Sanct. Auguſtin in lib. de Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Dei.</note> St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> where he ſpeaks of theſe <hi>Acephali</hi> and other Monſtrous Nations, ſomwhat better reſolves the doubt of their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall; It is demanded (ſaith he) whether <hi>Noahs</hi> ſonnes, or rather <hi>Adams</hi> (of whom all Mankind came) begot any of thoſe Monſtrous Men; and he concludes, that whatſoever he begot that is Man, that is, a Mortall reaſonable Creature, be his forme, Voyce, or whatever, never ſo different from any ordinarie mans, no Faithfull Perſon ought to doubt that he is of <hi>Adams</hi> Progeny: yet is the Power of Nature ſhewn and ſtrangely ſhewn in ſuch. God made all, and when or how he would forme this or that he knowes beſt, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the perfect skill how to Beautifie the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe by oppoſition and diverſity of parts; but he that cannot contemplate the Beauty of the whole, ſtumbles at the deformity of the part, and not knowing the Congruence that it hath with the whole. Yet God forbid that any one ſhould be ſo beſotted, as to think the Maker erred in theſe Mens Fabrick, though we know not why he
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:114623:40"/>
made them thus, be the diverſity never ſo great, he knowes what he doth and none muſt repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend him; therefore what Nations ſo e're have ſhapes differing from that which is in moſt Men, and ſeem to be exorbitant from the Common forme, if they be definable to be reaſonable Creatures and Mortall, they muſt bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowleged for <hi>Adams</hi> Iſſue. But St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> here ſpeaks more like a Divine then a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher; for although the ſupreame efficient and ſupernaturall cauſe of Monſters is God, and that when Nature ſeems to deflect from the common Law eſtabliſhed, ſhee is rapt by a Divine force, and there is <hi>aliquid Divini</hi> in the peculiar cauſe of theſe transfigurations of the Humane forme, and that the finall cauſe of theſe prodigious appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions may be the anger of God, who is no way bound to the Law of Nature, and who in revenge for ſome crime committed, may transforme a Man as he did <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> or give over a ſelf-deformed Nation, to the vanitie of their own inventions; yet it ſounds very harſh to the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of our Philoſophie, that the God of Nature ſhould be ſo glorified by ſuch ſtrange apparances, that evill and imperfect Creatures ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre to the perfection of the univerſe, ſince they have no reference to the Beauty of the World: becauſe the Beauty of the univerſe conſiſts in things perfect and permanent, and Monſters, <hi>(qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenus Monſters)</hi> being nothing but defects and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, can contribute no perfection, and ſo conſequently appertaine not to the Beauty of the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:114623:41"/>
univerſe; if they did conferr any ornament, they ſhould for the moſt part be produced, becauſe the great decorum of the World is ſuſtained by frequent effects, but Monſters happen rarely, and therefore they ought to be ſegregated from the Ornaments of the World; and if they had come to light to adorne the World, they had from the beginning of the World appeared, which we read of no where.</p>

But why this laterall compreſſion ſhould be the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:114623:47"/>
moſt proper and Naturall Figure of the Head, that the fore-part and hinder parts thereby are made more gibbous, and the finall cauſe thereof ought to be enquired.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Avicens</hi> opinion is,<note place="margin">Avicen.</note> that although the skull be round, yet it is oblong made in length, becauſe the originall of the Nerves are diſpoſed from the Brain in longitude, and therefore it was fit they ſhould not be ſtreightned, and it hath two Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencies, one before and another behinde, that the Nerves might deſcend, which deſcend to the front and the Nucha.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Zonardus</hi> well notes that the Head hath ſuch a Globous roundneſſe,<note place="margin">Zonardus</note> which on both ſides is ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what plaine, in the Anterior part it is ſomewhat acute and elevated, and that to retaine the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle of the Braine in the fore-deck of the Head, out of which the Nerves which cauſe the five Senſes proceed, and after the ſame manner, it is a little elevated in the hinder part for the reception of the Ventricle in the ſterne or hinder deck, from whence the ſpondible Marrow and the Nerves which procure voluntary motion ariſe.</p>

Secondly, becauſe the former and hinder Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle ought to have a greater cavity then the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and becauſe the middle Ventricle ought to be a way from one to the reſt; therefore it was neceſſary, that the Anterior and Poſterior parts

                  </note> the Braine is lightly depreſſed on each ſide, and a little exporrected in length for the foremoſt Ventricles ſake, made hollow in it, which appeares to be oblong, to whoſe hinder part the third Ventricle adheares, and to the third the fourth: wherefore a Brain not perfectly Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bous, but gently compreſſed on each ſide and lightly protended in length, was convenient for the Ventricles.</p>

                  <hi>Antonius <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lmus</hi> to theſe true opinions of the Ancients hath thought of another end of this Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the Head, which is confirmed by the teſtimony of ſence, who is of opinion that the Head was laterally compreſſed for the Eies-ſake, to wit, the better to promote the action of the Eie, whoſe action is then better when it exiſts more free. Now the Head compreſſed, the Eie is enlarged to the ſeeing of things backward to the right and left hand; and although not ſimply to the univerſall ſpace of a circular viſion, yet at leaſt to ſome portion of the ſame. Men may know the truth of this if they firſt try it in the Cephalicall compreſſion, ſtanding with a ſtiff Neck, and turning one Eie to the outward Angle, let them endeavour untill they perceive where the viſory Rayes doe come, in which experiment they had need have the place marked with ſome note; Afterwards, remaining fixt in the ſame place, and ſtanding juſt as in the ſame experiment, he would have them by ſome device to have their Heads rotunded or rounded, that they may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a perfect ſphericity, then let them turne the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:114623:48"/>
ſame Eie to the outward Angle, and try to finde whereabout or how farr the Viſory Rayes reach the place formerly ſeen, and marking it with ſome note; that done, let them conſult with Sence, what portion of the place is hid from the very Eye by rotunditie of the Head; for, Sence will apparently teach, that in this Cephalicall compreſſion to the ſides, the Eyes more freely expatiate to the back parts; the gaining of which advantage he thinks to be the cauſe of ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.</p>
               <p>Having thus preſented the artificiall contrivan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Mans Invention, practiſed on the Head, upon imaginary conceits of Beauty and genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, and diſcovered the inconveniences of ſuch fooliſh and phantaſticall devices, how deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie they are to the honour and Majeſtie of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and prejudiciall to her operations; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſet down the Canon of Nature, for the true and proper Figure of the Head, with the uſes and finall cauſe of ſuch a ſhape, which is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true and naturall forme of the Head; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving condemned them of the crime <hi>Laeſa Majeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> who have forced Art (the uſuall Imitator of Nature) to turne Praevaricator in humanity, wee cannot but commend thoſe Nations who have been tender in this point of offering violence to Nature, namely the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> whoſe Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes had a certain manner of bringing up their Children without having any Croſſe-cloaths,<note place="margin">

               <p>I knew a Gentleman had divers ſonns, and the Midwives and Nurſes had with head-bands and ſtrokings ſo altered the Naturall mould of their Heads, that they proved Children of a very weak underſtanding; his laſt Sonn only, upon ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice given him, had no reſtraint impoſed upon the Naturall growth of his Head, but was left free from the coercive power of head-bands and other Artificiall violence, whoſe Head although it were bigger, yet he had more Wit and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding then them all.</p>

                  <hi>That the Haire ſhould be, as theſe Nations conceive, a most abject excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, an unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble burthen, and a moſt unneceſſary and uncomely co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, and that Nature did never intend that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement for an Ornament, is a piece of Ignorance, or rather malicious impiety against Nature.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>How great an Ornament the Haire is to the Head, appears by the deformity is introduced by baldneſſe: If the Haire were an excrement, it ſhould be ſhut quite out of the Body, but this remaines in, and they have many different accidents, of which they ought to give a finall cauſe, and not to tie them to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of matter, which is ſuppoſed one end of their production. Neither doe they proceed from the fuligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous excrements of the Braine, as ſome are pleaſed to think, but rather as</hi> Spigelius <hi>well notes, of Blood attracted by the root of the Haire unto the reſt of the Plant and Trunck, which may be procured from thoſe things, which in other Creatures hold analogy with the Haires of Man. And therefore when the Braine is conſumed, baldneſſe enſues; the allowed
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:114623:53"/>
plenty of blood exhauſted, to wit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Naturall uſe of Haire.</note> 
                  <hi>that from whence Haires, and wherewith the Braine and the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant parts are nouriſhed. The prime end therefore of the Haire of the Head is to defend the skin, the ſecond uſe is to defend the Braine from injuries from without, or from within. From without there may happen to fall upon it Aire, Raine, Haile; from within, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, exhaling from the inferior parts, may prove troubleſome. The Aire may hurt the Head many waies, by coldneſſe conſtipating the Pores of the skin, whence the regreſſe of Vapours is exhibited; by heat, whence the Spirits are diſsipated and the Braine as it were ſod; by moiſtneſſe, relaxing the internall parts; by drineſſe, aſtringing all, and conſuming the innate hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miditie: againſt all theſe inconveniences (which the fooliſh malice of theſe Men bring upon their Heads) the Haire by covering the Head doth very aptly bring reliefe. Raine moiſtens, Haile ſmites on it; the denſity of the Haire keeps off one, the other the ductus or courſe of the Haire turns away; for the thickneſſe of the Haire admits not eaſily of Raine, and the turnings of the Haire doe ſtraightway caſt off the Haile that fals upon the Head. In like manner they abate the force of internall Contingencies, for they affoord a paſſage to Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, elevated from the inferior parts, and aſcending to the top of the Head, granting a free and open way unto them. And ſince the Braine is ſevered ſo farr from the Fountaine of heat, and confining ſo neer the Bones, and under them fenced with no fat, theſe Haires protect and warme it. They therefore that cut them wholly away, doe not only bring a deformitie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Nature, but affoord an occaſion to defluxions. Wee muſt avert (then) from Nature theſe calumnies of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:114623:53"/>
the opinions and practices of Men: That no Haire is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary or comely in Man; That Haires are a purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Body altogether unprofitable, growing on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that they may be ſhaved, being made by Nature to doe nothing: and recommend thoſe Coſmetiques as laudable, which preſerve Haire for the uſe and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Nature, condemning all thoſe wayes of decal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation practiſed by the Ancients to the prejudice of Nature, nothing but the rigid law of inexorable ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsity, in caſe of diſeaſes, being able to excuſe Man for introducing upon himſelfe a voluntary baldneſſe, ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving (generally ſpeaking) being ſervile, ridiculous, and proper to Fooles and Knaves, an infamous blot of effeminacy, an index of ignominy, calamitie and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, uncomely, becauſe allied unto depiled baldneſſe, being in ſooth a voluntary, ſpontaneous, and wilfull bald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; ſhaving off the Head unto the quick, being from all antiquity appropriated unto Fooles, being proper in them to ſignifie the utter deprivation of Wit and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and at firſt began in mockery and to move laughter; not to mention how repugnant it is to divine writ, it is apparently a ſhame and a diſgrace put upon Nature, and the reproach, as anindeleble Character of infamy, cleaves unto the memory of him who beares the Name of</hi> Corſes, <hi>for being the first who ſuffered the Haire of his Head to be ſhaved.

They are not of the Law of Nature which many Nations never had, nor have notice of, it muſt be known to all Men; Some think this Law is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in all Mens Hearts, explicitely as to ſome things, implicitely as to others, and we ſhall not charge all Nations of Malice or wilfull tranſgreſſion againſt the law of Nature, who nouriſh Haire beſides the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of Nature, ſince there are many concluſions which are of the law of Nature, which are not known to all Men.

'Tis true, that part in Bruits, which anſwers to the Forehead, is hairy, yet is thought no way to hinder the action of their Eyes: but that may be in regard their Eyes are placed more to the ſides then mens are, and their prone aſpect makes it not ſo inconvenient, and therfore we may with</hi> Hofman <hi>aske whether the erect Figure of Man did not require ſuch a ſmoothneſſe and bare Forehead: the growing of Haire in ſuch an inſolitary place,

is accounted and reckoned by</hi> Platerus <hi>for a deformity, ſince a large ſmooth Forehead is thought to add ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to the beauty of the part. They therefore who thus labour to remove the bound and Haire-marke of Nature, to cloud the throne of Love and Honour, and the Imperiall ſeat and manſion place of Wiſdome, placed in the front of Man, offer a groſſe indignity and deſpight unto Nature, and ſeeme to claime kindred of Cats, and Sowes, who among other hairy fronted A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals, have little and narrow Foreheads: And if Nature ſhould juſtly anſwer them in their folly of forcing their Haire to a preternaturall deſcent, and ſtreightning their Foreheads more then is convenient, (as ſhee ſometimes doth) ſhee ſhould ſend much craſſe and excrementitious humours about the forepart of the Braine, which ſhould make their Faces more inelabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and confuſed: that in their little Foreheads, by reaſon of tegument of Haire, and the humours in the forepart being leſſe perfrigerated then is fit, and heat agitating the humours, there ſhould enſue ſuch a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veable diſpoſition, as ſhould intercept and abate the purity of judication, which are the common accidents of ſuch Foreheads; for, little Foreheads containe but ſmal ventricles of the brain, whence the ſpirits ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and reflected, riſe againe, cauſing a mobility of cogitation.

moſt amiable and decent, and the Gallants will have (if Nature denie it them) by the provocations of Art, (as that will doe it:) yet we muſt accuſe them of a high Treſpaſſe committed againſt the Majeſtie of Nature, in that by that laboured prominence of their Forehead, they apparently damnifie Nature, in one of the moſt conſiderable and important actions of the Eye, which is the ſublime and contemplating aſpect thereof to Heaven. To vindicate the regular beauty and honeſty of Nature, from theſe Plaſtique Impoſtors, we ſay, that a Forehead that keeps its Naturall magnitude, is one of the uniſons of the Face, whoſe longitude (which we muſt conceive of a right line deſcending perpendicularly) is the third part of the Face, and ought to anſwer the length of the Noſe; ſo that if wee compare it to the rest of the Face, it ought to have the proportion of a halfe part to a duple: its longitude alſo naturally is ſuch, that the front is likewiſe in a duple proportion of one to two; you may conferre it with the gyre of the hinder part of the Head, after this manner, let the occiput of a man well proportioned, be meaſured with a thread, beginning at the part of the Temples, wherein the Haires terminate the Forehead, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it round in orb by the occiput, untill you end in the other part of the Temples, this thread will prove halfe the length, which is from both the Temples by the front and Synciput; this is the length of the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, and is to the circumference of the Occiput, under which the laſt venter of the braine is, and the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the After-braine, as one to two: and its altitude to the reſt in like manner, and to the whole Face, that it is its third, not otherwiſe alſo then it is the third part of the whole circumference of the Head.

               <p>Man is then perfect when he wants none of thoſe things which he ought to have, for that is his perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

It may be objected, that Man lives without theſe, and ſees: who denies it? but that man who is deprived of theſe, doth not live nor ſee humanely, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the order and lawes of kinde conſtituted by Nature. Whatever is in the Body of Man according to Nature, that is ſimply neceſſary, you may meaſure the neceſſity by the eſſence; for both are convertible: for if they prove defective, or anything be wanting, that Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is no longer perfect and abſolute, but lame and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect. Whatever Haire is in the Body, whatever it be, (ſo nothing happen beſides Nature) it is neceſſary, which we ought to be perſwaded of, and that by a reaſon, no way contemptible, taken from the dignity of Nature, who alwaies whatſoever ſhe doth, ſhee doth for ſome end; for 'tis abſurd, as <hi>Plotine</hi> ſaith, to ſay that there is ſomething conſtituted in the order of things, and to have nothing that it can; for an <hi>Ens</hi> is ſuch naturally, that it ſhould Act or ſuffer ſomething, which ſentence is not onely true of the ſpecies of Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in generall, but of all parts that Naturally exiſt in any ſpecifique Body, as thoſe haires doe: and if we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the uſes of the Haire in theſe parts, we ſhall ſoon perceive the folly and madneſs of theſe nations, who to their owne ſhame and prejudice, have rejected the naturall benefits intended them by the wiſdome and

providence of God, manifeſted in the Fabrique of the Eye-lids: for firſt, the great builder of our Body, hath impoſed a neceſsity upon them, of obſerving an equall proportionate magnitude, longitude, number, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervall; ſo that they need no clipping, making withall an exact proviſion for their inoffenſive poſiture from caſting any ſhadow upon the Eye, to intercept the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity of objects, or hindering the Eye from looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, which otherwiſe perchance might have been pretended and pleaded in excuſe of their impious depi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and robbing the Eye-lids of their defenſive Paliſado, not onely made (as ſome would have them) for an Ornament unto the Eye, but for perſpection, and to direct the ſight of the Viſory ſpirits, and the Rayes which flow from the Interior parts. And this by <hi>Kypler,</hi>

               <p>It is impoſſible the adulterate wit of women ſhould commit a fouler treſpaſſe againſt beauty, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of Nature, or introduce a more odious alteration in the Face, then is done by the contrivance of this faſhion; for, whence the Noſe ſhould excite ſo great a comlineſſe and beauty in the Face, cannot well be imagined, but from its Diſcrimination it makes of the parts thereof, for this diſcretion of the Noſe is ſo true and neceſſary to the whole Face,<note place="margin">Severinus.</note> that <hi>Severinus</hi> ſhould think, that this was the cauſe, for which it was made, that from this one part very much grace and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour ſhould accrew unto the Face, and that the Noſe either cut off, or vitiouſly depreſſed, there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth thereupon ſo great a deformity. Certainly the Face among all the parts, is therefore moſt honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and moſt goodly to behold: for that it is variouſly inſculpt and distinguiſhed. But what doth diſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and diſterminate the two Eyes, the two Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine Apples, the Cheeks, and the two ſides of the

               <p>For, the Noſe is placed in the very middle of the Face, as the moſt worthy and honourable ſcituation, and neceſſarily placed between the Eyes: ſince not onely a great beauty accrews unto the Face thereby, but as ſome will have it, it ſerves to diſtinguiſh the Eyes one from another, and is the cauſe that the viſory ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are not confounded and mixt together, and in the interim, being annexed on both ſides, to the bones of the Genae, it covers and fils up that horrid den, which otherwiſe would appeare ſo abominable unto the ſight, as it doth in their practiſe, who break down the partition wall that Nature had interpoſed between the Eyes, and againſt the law of Nature, remove her bounds and mangle that goodly promontory that runs along to divide the Paſifique Sea of beauty in the Face, thereby endeavouring to their owne confuſion, to joyn thoſe together, whom God and Nature had ſo wiſely ſeparated. By all which it is too too evident, what reall beauties theſe Nations deprive themſelves of, for an imaginary and ſuppoſed elegancie, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an affected deformity; whereby to the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurie of Nature, not onely the beautifull proportion of the Noſe is lost, but the officiall elegancy thereof very much impaired. For although notwithſtanding theſe faſhionable maimes of the Noſe, they may ſee, and breath, and ſpeake, and in ſome ſort enjoy the other uſes ſpoken of, yet not ſo well as they otherwiſe might, nor in ſo abſolute a manner as they ought, by the conſtitution of humane Nature.</p>

And verily who can ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently admire how this affected deformitie of a depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſaddle Noſe, came firſt in faſhion with theſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and like a contagion infected ſo great a part of mankind; or how ſo villanous an abſurdity ſhould in deſpight of Nature, be continued to this day: ſurely the Grand Deformer the better to ride the abuſed Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſies

of theſe people,<note place="margin">The Naſon of the prominen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the Noſe</note> hath clapt his ſaddle upon their Faces, and made this a ſhooing-horne to draw them on to other corporall vanities.</p>
               <p>By a most remarkable providence, it was ordered by Nature, that the Noſe ſhould be more prominent in one part, to be more apt thereby to give way a little to any thing falling upon it, which ſo eaſily ſlides off: ſo eminent, that it hides the Eyes as in a Cave and val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, as it were, becauſe they abhorr the contract of all things; therefore to defend the Eye, being after a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner like a ſhield, yet no way impedites viſion: for if about the ridge, ſpine, or back of the Noſe, it had been broad, it would have remain'd as an obſtacle to viſion, beſides, that the breadth would have disfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Face, all which inconveniences theſe Noſe-le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers muſt needs in ſome ſort incurre: nay, by this ſpreading their Noſes contrary to the Majeſticall inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Nature, they muſt ſomewhat prejudice the Noſe, not onely in thoſe actions wherein it is profitable for the bettering of our life, but to thoſe wherein it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to life it ſelfe. For theſe Nations who by their Apiſh affectation become <hi>Simi</hi> or <hi>Simones,</hi> they purchaſe onely a diſeaſe; for, the Figure of the Noſe is perverted; Yet this ſimitie it ſelfe is not the diſeaſe, but the diſeaſe wants a name, and is afterwards called by the name of a Symptome. But this diſeaſe hath a leſion of operations, otherwiſe it were not a diſeaſe, but rather a certaine deformity, therefore the diſeaſe is, becauſe the Noſe is obſtructed to the hinderance of reſpiration, and that obſtruction is a diſeaſe upon which there followes a leſion of operations; for, all theſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions certainly for want of a free reſpiration, ſo ſpeake, that they can ſcarce be understood, and they are ſaid to
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:114623:92"/>

Simity therefore is the cauſe, not the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, and the diſeaſe is in the evill figure, becauſe that which ought not to be depreſſed, is made depreſſed, and ſo makes it to be <hi>Morbus in figura</hi> or <hi>re figurata.</hi> And now who can deny theſe Nations to be ſick of the faſhions? and if their deſigne be to gain beauty thereby, they are much out of the way, ſince the Noſe is thereby hurt in its form, becauſe it is hurt in its adorning and beauty, which is thereby blemiſhed; and when its orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and beauty is blemiſhed, the very forme of it is hurt, and ſo conſequently the inſtrument; Yet we ought to know, that the imbelliſhment and beauty, doth not conſiſt in the ſoftneſſe and whiteneſſe of fleſh (as fond Women raſhly have entertained an opinion: But they conſiſt in a due conformation of parts and fit ſcituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to the end they may commodiouſly and aptly bring forth their operations, becauſe Ornament and beauty tend to the operation of the parts, as <hi>Galen</hi> affirmes.

Now that theſe Noſe-moulders many times prejudice nature in her operations, and blemiſh her perfections, is too apparent. But let us ſee yet farther, whether they obtaine their ends, which is to advance the beauty of their Faces, the rather, ſince one Hiſtorian imagineth that ſome of them doe. The figure of the Face generally ſeems to be diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in theſe differences, either it is oblong, round, or broad; for, a narrow face which is oppoſite unto a broad, is reduced to an oblong. So hence theſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences are reduced, either the Face is extended e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually according to its altitude and latitude, and ſo is an oblong Face: or is more exporrected according to latitude then longitude, and is called a broad Face; it is eaſie to imagine that the longitude, which we alſo call the altitude, is to be taken from the Forehead to the Chin, the latitude on the contrary, from cheek to cheek. Some bring in another rotunditie of Face, which is when it doth ſwell, and is prominent into the anterior part, to which roundneſſe they oppoſe a hollow, to wit, which is depreſſed. In a varied expreſſion, wee may ſay, a Face this way round is that which is Convex in the forepart, a Hollow-face
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:114623:94"/>
is that which in the ſame part is Concave.<note place="margin">Wherein the beauty of the Noſe conſiſts.</note> Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that which is commonly called the figure of the Face: there is another which is compounded of the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the ſeverall parts of the Face, and of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance and reſpect they have among themſelves, which Critiques in beauty call the Forme. And the front alone (as is obſerved) may be varied above <hi>576</hi> waies, and therefore the Noſe infinitely more, but many parts may be varied in ſeverall wayes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and various complications among themſelves, from whence ariſeth that infinite (almoſt) variety of humane Formes. Now beauty reſides in the Forme; for if every part be rightly formed, and rightly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent one unto another, the Face will be beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, if it have withall a pleaſing colour. But the parts may all be beautifull, and yet not well anſwer one another; as for example: A ſhort, long, ſtrait, crook't or Aquiline Noſe, little or great, if they be Graphically conſtituted, may be beautifull; but the queſtion will be, what figure of other parts is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to make up the perfect harmony of a Face. A faire high Hawks Noſe, rather agrees with a faire plump Cheek, then with a faire thin Cheek: and on the contrary, a beautifull Cheeke but leane, doth rather love a ſtrait Noſe, then an Aquiline. The <hi>Perſians</hi> therefore to make good the beauty, as well as the tranſcendent dignity of their Noſes, had need have convex or full extant Faces, as indeed for the moſt part they have. As for the <hi>Tartars</hi> and <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noiſe,</hi> who affected a flat Noſe, it muſt needs be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, it is not unſuitable unto their broad Faces; but how can the ſame Noſe beautifie a round Face, ſuch as the <hi>Guineans</hi> and they of <hi>Caſſara,</hi> in the lower

                  <hi>Man had a mouth given him for the better preparing his meat for his ſtomack, for breathing, and for ſpeech; for which a little mouth was held ſufficient. For women then (in whom a little Mouth was ever held moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, and that by reaſon of, I know not what Analogy is wont to be deduced thence) to affect com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of beauty from a wide Mouth, is very ſtrange, and much derogating from the honeſty of Nature, and her ordinary juſtice: for, the deduction or longitude of the Mouth, ſhould but equall the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude of the Eye, which extends from the outward angle to the Lachrymall; ſo that the longitude of the Mouth is duple to the ninth part of the longitude of the Face, and the Noſe ſhould beare a ſeſquialtera proportion unto it, and the width of the Mouth ſhould be but as much againe as the bottom of the Noſe near the Mouth, the circumference of it double, and the deduction of it treble, to the longitude of the Noſe: ſo that the whole longitude of the Face, ſhould beare a ſeſquialtera proportion to the compaſſe of the Mouth, or to the ſpace contained between the corners of the Eye, for this ſpace ſhould equall the compaſſe (alſo) of the Mouth, and the circumference of the Eare ought to be uniſon; The first joynt (likewiſe) towards the hand in the middle finger, ſhould be as much as the Mouth, if you meaſure the bow of the lip with a thread; for if you meaſure it right in the longitude of the empty Mouth, that part of the finger would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed it.

                  <hi>and is communicated unto the heart. Againe, beſides theſe parts deſtined to divers offices, there is a peculiar proviſion for the windpipe, that is a Cartilagineous flap upon the opening of the Larinx or throate, which hath an open cavitie for the admiſsion of the aire; but leaſt thereby either meat or drink ſhould deſcend, providence hath placed the Epiglottis, Ligula, or flap, like an Ivie leafe, which alwaies cloſeth when we ſwallow, or when the meat and drinke paſſeth over it into the gullet, leſt any ſhould ſlide into the rough arterie, or ſome crumb (as we uſe to ſay) ſhould goe awry. And the contrivance of Natures artifice in this flap is very remarkable; which being rigid and erect by Nature, by reaſon of its firmer and ſtricter connexion in the hollow of the bone Hyoides, it is alwaies deteined erect by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening of a thicker ligament, by reaſon of the neceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of reſpiration, wherein our life conſiſts, whereby the pipe of the rough arterie remaines open, leſt the heart ſhould be ſuffocated, notwithſtanding being flex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible, that it might perfectly ſhut the chinks upon which it is recalled, when wee ſwallow our meat and drink, by whoſe weight it is depreſſed, leſt any thing during the time of eating and drinking ſhould fall into the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon, having ſwallowed them, preſently like a ſpring it is lifted up, and returnes to its poſture: ſo that if we ſpeake in the very act of eating or drinking, that will be enforced to open, to let out the matter of ſpeech, which is the breath, and ſo expoſed; If any meat or drink imprudently fall into the Arterie, it ſtraightwaies ſtrangles or excites a cough, untill by the force of the breath it be ejected, becauſe that thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending, hinders reſpiration, and ſo conſequently

                  <hi>wherefore Nature neceſſarily riſeth up to the expulſion of it. And this is the reaſon why a man cannot drinke and breathe at the ſame time, and that if we laugh while we drinke, the drink flies out at the noſtrils, and why; when the water enters the weazon, men are ſuddenly drowned. Verily theſe men anſwer not the intention of Nature, neither cheriſh their bodie ſo well as otherwiſe they might. And they had need feed very warily and ſilently (as they doe) for meat being in its own Nature corpulent, compact and groſſe, and ſometimes devoured in greater gobbets then is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, ſometimes being harder as not well chawed, ſometimes gluttinous and clammy, and therefore apt to ſtick in the gullet; for many times the meat when it is not well ſhread is deteined in its paſſage: And to remove downward this deteined</hi> Bolus, <hi>we ſtand in need of drink; and therefore drink may not be only eſteemed the Vehicle of aliment through the moſt narrow regions of the veines, but its Vehiculum in all places; and not onely through the whole gullet, but alſo where the meat deſcends from the gullet into the ſtomack, by the benefit of this liquid vehicle it is carried through the whole bottom of the ventricle, and runs out alſo to the right ſide. On the other ſide the gullet is ſoft and not open, as the rough artery is, but eaſily fals upon it ſelfe, and ſtaies the deſcent of meat, which otherwiſe, it was convenient ſhould deſcend as ſoone as may be, as well for the compreſsion of the adjacent parts, as the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, leſt it ſhould delay the concoction of the meat. And although Nature not thinking fit to commit this neceſſary action, to the weight onely of the meat, whereby it is moved of it ſelfe, would have it mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of another: and notwithſtanding that the gullet
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:114623:123"/>
moveth the meat into the ſtomack by naturall inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that is by ſtreight Fibres not only attracting it,</hi>

Therefore when the meat, thruſt from the mouth to the beginning of the gullet, and ſtreightned in and compreſſed by the tranſverſe muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule, and being conſtrained to paſſe by the gullet, and forthwith attracted by the right Fibres, and by a conveniency of qualitie of the ventricle, and driven forward, and in a manner compreſs'd or altogether compreſs'd by the tranſverſe Fibres, comes ſtreight in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſtomack; the action of the gullet, that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutition, is performed and conſummated, the action being animall and partly Naturall. And that this ſtronger motion is required in the top of the gullet, the Larinx is the cauſe, which being of a thick body cartilagineous and rigid, and placed at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the gullet, it had altogether hindred the ingreſſe of meat into the gullet, unleſſe Nature had here conſtituted a muſcule; the opifex of deglutition; neither would this muſcule ſuffice, by reaſon of the thick and hard body of the Larinx, oppoſed unto the gate of the gullet, unleſſe the Larinx at the inſtant of deglutition ſhould recurve it ſelfe upward, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke the compreſſed mouth of the stomack; for it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares,

                  <hi>Theſe are the only men who ſeem able to deny that the gullet or inner pipe of the Neck, the meat-pipe or viand-pipe hath any publike action, and that it is the way and paſſage onely, and doth nothing but as it is pervious and hallowed along, therein it affordeth a way and paſſage to the meat. But action is a motive action, which is brought forth of it ſelfe, and it is not an action, or to doe, to be a way, but only a uſe, which is in all that doe nothing. If the gullet ſhould act, its action would altogether conſist about meat and drink; but if it carry the unconfected meat, it works nothing upon the meat, and therefore there is no action of the throat: Yet in the judgment of the beſt

In which the Beard hath the chiefeſt place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing planted in the part thereof, which the Ancients ſtiled the Temple of Goodneſſe and Honesty. The time of its appearance, denotes its uſe, it is inchoate, and begins to come forth at a certaine definite and ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique time, (for man is not at once an <hi>Individuum</hi> and a ſpecifique <hi>Individuum</hi>) the libration of which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of time is chiefly conspicuous to God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by his Counſell, which diſpenſation of time is not without a myſtery, to which all things created are ſubjected.

Such a ſtratagem of improvement the pragma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall invention of man hath proved effectuall in the Tongues of other Creatures, it being a common pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice to ſlit the Tongues of Pies, Stares, Jayes, and Daws, whom we would teach to ſpeake, to inable them the better to imitate the articulation of our ſpeech. Yet for the honour of Nature, we must queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whether this device be not ſomewhat deſtructive to the numericall perfection of the Body, ſince that prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſition in Philoſophy is moſt true, That Nature neither abounds in ſuperfluous things, nor is defective in neceſſaries; for ſhe doth nothing in vaine, nor cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates any thing diminiſhed, unleſſe ſhe be hindred by matter. Now ſince this device pretends to double the proviſion of Nature by addition of a ſupernumerary particle, although it be <hi>quid naturale,</hi> the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is probably hurt in its operations, the number of parts requiſite to the compoſition of the Instrument is depraved, either (as wee ſpeake) by minoration or majoration. And if this multiplication of Tongues out of the ſubſtance of the Body there ſhould be added to the number of the parts, it must prove ſuperfluous; and how ſhall ſuch an attempt be anſwered to Him who made all things in number, meaſure, and in weight.</p>

                  <hi>ſaith he, hath heard of Dr</hi> Aquapen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, <hi>that in certaine places of</hi> Italy <hi>the Midwives were perſwaded that the bridle of the Tongue had need of cutting in all Infants, therefore they wore the Naile of their right Thumbe long, but conform'd into the riſing edge of a pen-knife, wherewith ſuddenly as ſoone as the Infants are borne they breake that ligament or bond.</hi>

                  <hi>Kyplerus</hi> condemns this tearing of it thus with the fingers, as certaine raſh women are wont to do, ſince through the paine there follows a flux of humours, inflamation, and other miſchiefes, and when it is neceſſary to be cut, he would have it done by Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgicall operation with a paire of Sizers. <hi>Caſſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> alſo takes notice of this cuſtome of unskilfull Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives, fooliſhly beleeving, that unleſſe they ſhould do ſo, the Infant would remaine mute. <hi>Bauhinus</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighs againſt this pernicious cuſtome of ignorant Midwives, that they indifferently cut that which they call the bridle-ſtring of the Tongue, to wit, that ſtrong and membranous Ligament which was ordained for the ſtrength and ſtability of the Tongue, and the inſertion of its proper Muſcles. <hi>Camerarius</hi> ſaith, this opinion is pernicious, and not to bee endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. And <hi>Fabricius Hildanus, Columbus,</hi> and others cry out againſt it. There is indeed a moſt ſtrong Ligament, membranous and broad, placed under the middle of the body of the lower part of the Tongue, by whoſe aide the ſoftneſſe of the Tongue under-propped it is more eaſily rolled about and produced; to the end of this about the tip of the Tongue there is a little cord
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:114623:147"/>
or Ligament groweth,<note place="margin">The uſe of the Tongues bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle.</note> which they call the Bridle of the Tongue; and the Tongue hath a Ligament for two cauſes: Firſt, for the firmament of its Baſis; for if it had been without this, the Muſcles in their action (or their contraction to their principle) had had nothing to rely upon; and ſo it would have come to paſſe, that the Tongue would be convolved, as it were, into a Globe; ſecondly, that the tip of it might be eaſily moved every way; for, unleſſe that were, there would be much of the voice loſt in dearticulation; and as <hi>Caſſerius</hi> notes, it reſtraines the Tongue from being drawn backe beyond meaſure by the over-ſtreining of the anterior Muſcles, to which it is a helper; and it hinders the Tongue from being put forth too monſtrouſly and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently, and from being too exorbitantly led to any one ſide. But that it ſhould alwaies need the Midwives naile, or great, or the Chirurgeons Pen-knife, leſt it ſhould prove an impediment to ſucking, or to future ſpeech, and without which enlargement it could not be freely roll'd or mov'd every way, is a moſt dangerous conceit. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly theſe Midwives (as women are great friends to loquacity, joine in opinion with theſe Authors, who therein playing the Rhetoricians) opine that Nature im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed this bridle upon man; leſt he ſhould prove too tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kative, which morall uſe holds not; for there are ſome (as <hi>Kypler</hi> notes) that are too talkative, who have this Bridle ſhort enough, and there are ſome not ſo full of prattle, although this bond be looſe enough to give them ſcope; for, Loquacity or Taciturnity depends upon a higher principle, and therefore their blind zeale in this buſineſſe is the more reprovable.</p>

                  <hi>Camerarius</hi> thinks, that this never-enough con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned cuſtome grounded hereupon, might poſsibly be

introduced into the Midwives practice,<note place="margin">A Caution for cutting.</note> from the ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of ſome Phyſitians, who pretended this bond in all Infants doth ſo ſtrictly tye the Tongue to its root, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as without reſection of the ſame, ſpeech would become lame and imperfect; and thereupon without any neceſsity, the Midwives in many Nations began to dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerate and breake it indifferently in all Infants. But ſince neither Parrots nor Pies ſtand in need of any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of this Bond to utter their voice ſuch as it is, it would ſeeme a wonder if Sagacious Nature ſhould faulter only in the forming of that part which was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to ſerve ſpeech proper to Mankind.

               <p>But let us distinguiſh, and grant, that it ſometimes ſo fals out, that even as in other parts of the Body, ſo alſo in this little Bond, Nature failes and offends, as it were, in exceſſe, upon which occaſion ſection is not unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but it is to be eſteemed neceſſary: But that Nature, the tender mother of all things, doth alwaies in all Children commit this errour, the beſt of the Learned conſtantly deny, ſome of them witneſsing (as before) that by omitting that Ruption, or rather more truly Corruption, according to their advice, the Children have notwithſtanding ſpoke very perfectly: and on the contrary, by the ſame fooliſh inſtitution of Midwives others to have died, inflamation being raiſed by the rude hand of unskilfull women, which hath cauſed pain and hindred their ſucking; therefore when we ſuſpect either a ſlowneſſe, or depravation of the Tongue, we ought to defer the diſſection untill the appointed time

Now it is an obſervation worth the inſerting, that the Chin is correſpondent to the Symetry of the other members of the Body; but that which ſeemes the greater marvell, is, that the formall appearance of the face is generically repoſed in the Chin alone; for if that be ſquare, long, or round, ſo the Face of it ſelfe anſwers, inſomuch as the Chin is that which makes the finall judgement of the Face of man. Now if theſe be Face-Moulders, as it is much to be ſuſpected they are, it may be they have ſome artifice to dilate the Chin, thereby prophaning the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry of Nature, and ſtriving by Art to force and pervert the Face from its juſt proportion, bringing the Latitude thereof either to equall, or exceed the Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, while they, to the great diſhonour of Nature, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect a ſquare Geometricall Face.</hi>

                  <hi>To defend the Dignity and Majeſty of Nature in the increaſe of Nailes,</hi> Galen <hi>ſaith, becauſe either with ſcratchings, or other actions the ends of them weare away, Nature hath allowed theſe parts only a power of continuall encreaſe, although the whole body hath left off to be encreaſed. Not as other parts in all the dimentions of length, breadth, and profundity, but in length only, other new nailes alwaies growing under the old, and driving forward the old. Neither was this inſtitution vain, but in ſupplement and reparation of the decay of nailes, by which device the conſtruction of the nails was brought up to the higheſt pitch of Natures Providence, whoſe will, verily, in commending the providence of Nature is commendable. But</hi> Ulmus <hi>goes a better way to defend this notable proviſion of Nature, affirming that her ineffable wiſdome had no reſpect in giving that power to the Nailes, to any thing imperfect, but rather very perfect; for, this argument is referred to warne the naturall ſoule that it ſhould not be loath or aſhamed to deſcend to conform and take care for the Body (alſo;) which admonition and deſcention doth not only elevate the forces of our Soule, but rather very much increaſe them: for ſhe collects this, admoniſhed by ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, (for ſhe is rationall,) If I muſt deſcend to the

                  <hi>This agitation of the mind about corporall parts, and the ever-growing nailes, makes the Soule more boldly and ventrouſly to reflect upon it ſelfe, and to inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate better things. Wherefore theſe parts and motions of the ſoule, to conſerve them, may be aſsimilated to ſin, which ſometimes becomes profitable to the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſour: So we compare theſe monſters of time and place to ſins, for they teach the utility and commodity of the naturall worke. We tremble to pronounce any thing in Nature to be beſides Nature: but this neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry care about the perpetuall increment of nailes we may affirme to bring many commodities to mankind. Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is the beginning of our contemplation, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens by reaſon of the diſsipation of thoſe things which conſtitute our bodies, being occult, and a thing which eſcapes the reach of our Senſes: who ever condemned this Hunger? none ever; becauſe it is the worke of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, working naturally, and admoniſhing us of alition, and the worke of the Nutrative faculty. Hunger would not happen unleſſe the parts of the Body did decreaſe, the ſence of which decrement when it comes upon us, is called Hunger; the perpetuall increment of the Nailes is correſpondent to the decrement of Hunger; for, as Hunger admoniſheth us that ſomething is to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that the diſsipated ſubſtance may be repaired: In like ſort this increaſe of the Nailes puts us in mind that we muſt detract ſomewhat that theſe parts may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate to the operation of Nature, and no way hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or disturbe her; for, when the extravagant nailes grow too long, by that importune accrement, they hinder the tops of the fingers if men be to uſe them upon im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. Theſe Nations then that are ſo unpolitick,

Theſe therefore, who are ſo Salvage and far eſtranged from humane life, as not to abhor the ſordid toleration of their growth, which very much diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth us, when by any neglect they gaine an extravagant and claw like aſpect, have little care or reſpect of their own bodies. Not but that the increment of the Nailes is very naturall, and the care of theſe (though ſmall things) is in very Nature; nay, the care of theſe parts is more noble than the care of our nouriſhment, ſince the care of them appertaines to reaſon, and to the practick Intellect; and by how much the practick Intellect is more noble than the nutrient Soule, ſo much to a more noble order doth the care of the Nailes in conforming them to the Law of Nature appertaine. And this care is ſo proper to man, that it hath its vertues and vice, which yet is very difficult to be underſtood by common wits. For as the Advancer of Learning ſaith, it hath parts Civill, and parts Effeminate; For, cleanneſſe and the civill beauty of the body was ever eſteemed to proceed from a modeſty of behaviour and a due reverence in the firſt place towards God, whoſe Creatures we are, then to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Society wherein we live, and then towards our ſelves, whom we ought no leſſe, nay much more to revere than we do any others. Now, the Nailes are exiſtent parts which alwaies (almoſt) grow; and when they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur ſuch an exceſs of an increaſed quantity, they do but hinder the operations of the humane Soule, and when they decline from their proper Mode of quantity, and increaſe further, the Deduction and Moderation of their

Now the Organs of the practique Intellect are to rectifie and regulate the excreſcent, ſupercreſcent, and ever-creſcent parts; for, in all parts there is an appointed end, a certaine commoderation of the quantity of parts to the actions of them, according to the faculties uſing the Organ in the Body. Neither are Nailes</hi> extra hominem, <hi>unleſſe in carkaſſes and thoſe buried: And their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall increaſe in man is an Argument of a Divine Nature, a prerogative in which beaſts cannot partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate, and teacheth us charity to our Bodies. The neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of this charity proves not only an inconvenience, but as ſome thinke, long Nailes is a ſin, to avoid which</hi> Adam <hi>in the eſtate of innocency in Paradiſe, before Inſtruments of Iron were found, perchance bit his Nailes: Yet ſurely in the ſtate of Innocency his abode in Paradiſe was ſo ſhort, that no inconvenience could happen unto him this way, nor any neceſſity enforce him to cut his nailes; although he had too juſt a cauſe to bite his nailes afterwards. Verily it is obſerved that Nature in the Nailes hath ſhewed us as a Law of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, whilest in Children, when they grow long, they naturally fall off, untill becomming harder, they cannot be ſo commodiouſly ſeparated by Nature alone. And therefore by no worſe a Law of Nature do we cut our Nailes than our Haire, lest they ſhould grow into an odious and hooked curvity. Unnaturall ſlovens

                  <note place="margin">The uſe of the Nailes.</note> 
                  <hi>and very little have they to ſhew themſelves Gentlemen who have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but long nailes as the Creſts of idle Gentility. 'Tis true, the nailes do decreaſe and weare by labour, and idleneſſe no way arreſts their encreaſe, according to the doctrine of</hi> Galen, <hi>which theſe mens fancies approve. And therfore the obſervation is not ſo ſubtile (as</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curialis <hi>notes) which</hi> Cardan <hi>ſpeakes of in his book</hi> de ſubtilitate, <hi>to wit, that he ſaw one who all his life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time had no need to cut his nailes. For, the Ruſticks and moſt of your handicraft-men never pare their nailes, becauſe they weare away of their own accord in their working; yet the end of their perpetuall growth is not to repaire their decay by working, ſince if men ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver worke yet their nailes grow. The Nailes (againe) have that order among the ſimilar parts of the hand, that they are not in the number of them that performe an action, but of thoſe that are ſubſervient, for they were made for the better apprehenſion; their ſcituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and hardneſſe gives them this. And therefore the other reaſon of the</hi> Nayros, Portugals, <hi>and</hi> Meſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chos, <hi>who were them long for the better griping and holding faſt their Rapiers, may better paſſe, ſince there is ſome allowance to be given to men whoſe profeſſion may be advantaged by a more extravagant extent of the Naile. But for women to nouriſh long Nailes as a beauty, is a ſtrange</hi> Soleciſme, <hi>and a greater breach of the Law of Nature; eſpecially</hi> ſi dantur ungues ſexuales, <hi>as ſome hold in the Affirmative. Nature as</hi> Galen <hi>obſerves, allows ſtrong Nailes only to them that have ſtrong Teeth, becauſe ſtrong nailes anſwer to ſtrong teeth, and ſo upon the contrary;</hi> Plato <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore writes, that the Nailes were made</hi> Notae gratia,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:114623:178"/>
                  <hi>for a figurative token;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Nailes, no Armes.</note> 
                  <hi>For ſince man was among mild Creatures, either becauſe he hath reaſon, which much conduceth to manſuetude, he ought not to have ſtrong nailes, ſince he hath not ſtrong Teeth; much leſſe hath that impotent Sex any colour of pretence to long and ſtrong nailes, ſince the nailes were never intended as weapons of offenſive ſcratching, either in man or woman.</hi> Alcibiades <hi>(as the Marqueſſe of</hi> Malvezzi <hi>well obſerves) contending with another Boy, makes uſe of his Teeth and Nailes, peradventure to ſhame him whom he could not hurt, and being not able to ſtrike would marke him; his enemy taxeth him for being womaniſh, to fight with ſuch inſtruments as were not given him by Nature for that purpoſe; He glorieth to be Lion-like. Nailes commonly ſerve men and beaſts to cover the extremity of Veines, Sinews, and Arteries, that the naturall, animall, and vitall ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits might not evaporate that way; they alſo ſerve ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny beaſts, in particular for offenſive and defenſive armes. If Nature doth not purge the humours by convenient waies, it is either too weake, or too much oppreſſed; if a man vents his wrath with unbeſeeming weapons, either his rage ſwelling too high makes him mad, or his weakneſſe caſts him down. The ſhape of the mouth, the ſcituation of it, the weakeneſſe of Teeth, are all evident ſigns that Nature did not place them there for his defence: And who will imagine the nailes to be mans armes, ſeeing that when he will fight he hides them, and whereas other Creatures ſtrike with an open paw, he only fights with a cloſed fiſt? But ſince they weare them for a beauty, it may be they have ſome ſuch like conceit as</hi> Ariſtophanes <hi>puts upon the Philoſophers, who kept their nailes unpared, not for

Hereupon becomming crook-backt and lame, the naturall proportion of the body is depraved, and the body made incommenſurate; for, whereas a meaſure taken from the Crown of mans head to the ſole of his foot ſhould anſwer to the diſtance between the middle finger of his right hand to the middle finger of his left hand when the Armes are ſtretched out to the full length; this proportion can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be obſerved in crook-backt men, and hence they are juſtly accounted unproportioned.</p>

Alſo after nine months you may ſuffer them to put on ſhooes, about which time they will be able to trample on the ground, and to hold themſelves upright, and that they may do twice or thrice in a day, and afterwards compell them by little and little, and by degrees to go by ſteps, ſo that by that labour you do not very much enforce them, but gently, untill they attaining more ſtrength deſire it of themſelves, and may without harme endure it.</p>

                  <hi>We in</hi> England <hi>are noted to have a moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe cuſtome of ſwathing Children, and ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their Breaſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which narrowneſſe of Breaſt, occaſioned by hard and ſtrict ſwadling them, is the cauſe of many inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences and dangerous conſequences. For, all the bones of
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:114623:194"/>
new-borne Infants, eſpecially the Ribs of the Breaſt,<note place="margin">The naturall proportion of the Breaſts.</note> are very tender and flexible, that you may draw them to what figure you pleaſe; which when they are too ſtrictly ſwathed with Bands, reduce the Breaſt to ſo narrow a ſcantling as is apt to endanger, not only the health, but the life of Children. For hence it is, that the greateſt part of us are ſo ſubject to a Conſumption, and diſtillations, which ſhorten our daies, and bring us to an untimely Grave: For they who have more ſtreight and narrow Breaſts, are neceſſarily made op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune to ſpitting of bloud, diſtillations and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamations of the parts of the Breaſt, ſince the Lungs in ſuch grow very hot; for when the reſt of the body retaines its proportion and due magnitude, and the Breast is made narrower, more bloud is collected about the Breast than it can digeſt or expell from it ſelfe, whence neaſting in thoſe cavities (eſpecially of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terious veines, or veine-Arterie,) degenerates into the cauſes of many diſeaſes. Moreover, the Breaſt it ſelfe corrected is very much weakned, whereupon the bloud flowing thither hotter, or (ſticking there) becoming ſharpe, doth eaſily erode the veſſels, neither is Nature now able to defend her ſelfe any longer. The Breaſt hath an Ovall figure, in its naturall magnitude, it doth make eight Geometricall inches, to wit, that which begins at the throat-bone, and is terminated in the ſword-like cartilage; the Back from the firſt Vertebra of the Breaſt to the end of the twelfth, or reaching to the beginning of the firſt of the Loines, obtaines a Geometricall foot and one inch: So that the Breaſt is ſhorter than the Back by five Inches, the ſides run out from the Clavicula to the end of the Breaſt, where the Baſtard-Ribs end, and have nine inches and a halfe;
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:114623:195"/>
the Perepheria of the Breaſt is two Geometricall foot and two Inches.<note place="margin">Swathing a cauſe of the Rickets.</note> If you render your breadth it is nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed an Inch; If you take it in, it is dilated two Inches, this is the naturall proportion. Now when ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Nature, or this fooliſh violence of Art, the Breaſt by compreſſing is made narrower and unpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, the Scapulae uſually appeare prominent, and they become ſuch as <hi>Hipocrates</hi> calls Alatos, and by that fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure obnoxious to a Phtyſique, the back-bone not only being hurt, and they made gibbous, but the Lungs thereupon cannot preſerve their figure: the beſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription therefore for ſuch who are become this way proclive to a Phtyſique, is to uſe ſuch exerciſes as gently dilate and extend the Breaſt, as ſhooting, vociferation, commotion of the Armes, and attraction and compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of much breath, which yet must be done with caution and without violence. Among ſuch, and other the like inconveniences, occaſioned by this unhappy cuſtome, it is very remarkable, that the Rickets, a diſeaſe frequent with us, but ſcarce known where they uſe not to ſwath their Children, is occaſioned, as I am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, (and ſome good Phyſitians are of the ſame opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) only by this perverſe cuſtome of ſwathing, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an obſervation among ſome Ladies that I have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed with, that no Children that are kept with a Belly-bands only, and not ſwathed ſtreight upward, are troubled with the Rickets; A notion worth the taking notice of by thoſe who would not have their Children grow ſick of the Faſhions. And although Doctor <hi>Gliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> and the other Doctors his Aſsiſtants in that lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Tract, which to their great honour they have lately publiſhed of this new diſeaſe, commonly called the Rickets, or more properly the Rackets; where they
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:114623:195"/>
ſpeake of the cauſes of the Curvity of the bones,<note place="margin">The cauſe of the Rickets enquired into.</note> they do not wholly aſſent to their opinions who aſcribe it to the flexibility of Bones, inveighing againſt Nurſes which prematurely commit Infants and Children to their feet, thinking that their bones are bent by the weight of the ſuſtained body, nor to others likewiſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing the unskilfull way of ſwathing practiſed by Nurſes: yet they partly grant, that in ſo tender an age the bones may perchance be ſomewhat bent, yet they would not remaine bent as Lead or Wax, but left to their liberty they would at length returne to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per poſition of the parts; for they do not conſiſt of a Ductile matter, in ſo much as they would be broken in the bending, or would certainly endeavour to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the former ſite of parts. And as to the unskilfulneſſe and careleſneſſe of Nurſes, they do not wholly excuſe them, yet they thinke they cannot juſtly impute this Curvity unto them; ſince they ſee that the Children of poore men are handled with leſſe care, and ſooner com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their feet than Gentlemens Children are, and yet their children are more rarely infeſted with this infirmity than theirs; and they have known Nurſes, who having uſed the uttermoſt diligence both in ſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and other waies of handling Infants, that they have given ſuck unto, yet they could not prevent or avoid this Curvity of the bones. But where they come to ſpeake of the Cauſes, why, in tract of time, the Spine or Rack-bone cannot be raiſed up according to a ſtraight and naturall line; here verily (ſay they) we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not at all excuſe the negligence and careleſneſſe of nurſes, that they do not attentively enough obſerve unto which part rather, Infants whom they ſuckle, are prone to encline their body, to the end they may diligently
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:114623:196"/>
and carefully endeavour to direct it to the oppoſite part.<note place="margin">Where they never ſwath Children.</note> Likewiſe alſo, when Nurſes prematurely and without regard commit weaker Infants to their feet, it may fall out, that ſince the Tonique motion of the Muſcles is not ſufficient for ſuſtentation of the Body, they may ſuffer the Knee or Leg of the Child to be ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into one ſide; whereupon the Ligaments of the joint are extended either on the inner or outward ſide and by conſequence the Ligaments of the adverſe ſides are contracted, whereby the Ioint muſt neceſſarily be bended either outward or inward. Therefore although they had above denied the Curvity of the Bones to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon this, yet they grant that the distortion of Ioints in weake Infants may happen through ſuch a careleſneſſe of Nurſes; granting moreover, that by their constant and fooliſh Faſciation, the bones, which otherwiſe were ſtreight, may be incurvated, although they do not eſteeme it to be the constant and ordinary cauſe of this organicall infirmity.</p>

               <p>Fond opinion (indeed) hath obtained this with us, that Children, unleſſe they were diligently involved and conſtrained in ſwathing-bands, they would have diſtorted Legs: Which the <hi>Barbarians</hi> take leaſt care of, who put their Infants new borne naked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwathed into their Hamacchos, whoſe Children not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding of all Mortals go moſt ſtreight. 'Tis confeſſed, the temperature of the aire doth very much availe to that purpoſe, and therefore we may allow our Children in Winter-time to be diligently involved and bound up with ſwath-bands in their Cradles, becauſe otherwiſe they are unfit to endure the Cold of our Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate: but in Summer and temperate ſeaſons of the yeare (especially when there is no froſty weather, with others good leave, ſaith a learned Phyſitian) I ſhould thinke (as much as I can attaine by experience) that Infants are to be freed from theſe bands and ſet at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; ſome kind of Couch invented for that purpoſe, out of which they cannot fall; and verily (ſaith he) I am of that mind, that the extraordinary heat doth not a little incommodate, wherewith Children in the time of Summer revinct with ſwath-bands are as it were ſtew'd.</p>
               <p>Yet it is not to be omitted what our Phyſitians ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in their late learned Tract of the Rickets; That

For they on every ſide involve the whole body, except the head, in one continued inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; whence the outward parts of the body, and the firſt affected in this diſeaſe are defended againſt the injuries of the externall cold, and the hot exhalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons breaking out from any part of the Body, by that ſwadling-clout perchance doubled or trebled, and rolled about with ſwath-bands, are evenly retained, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually communicated to all parts of the Body, that they may be cheriſhed as it were in a common ſtove with an equall heat. Therefore ſince the chiefe part of the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of this diſeaſe conſiſts in an equall cold diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, no marvell if theſe muniments of the body do avert it, at leaſt for a time: But when after ſome months, if not ſooner, the hands of Infants are freed from that common covering, as the Cuſtome is, and perchance before they are ſix months old, their feet alſo in the day time, although they are againe ſwathed at night, all the day at least, their outward members are deſtitute of this common nouriſher of naturall heat: Our Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes alſo, (as they judiciouſly note) often erre while they too ſoone coat feebler Infants; for they unhappily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine the time of Coating Children by number of months, whereas they ought rather to make their account out of the activity and ſtrength of motion in their feet and hands: for when the motion and exerciſe of thoſe
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:114623:198"/>
parts may more confer to excite and cheriſh their heat,<note place="margin">A ſtrange way of ordering Children.</note> and irritate their pulſes, than the nouriſhment of ſwath-bands, without doubt then is the mature time for Children to be freed from their primative inrollments, having then no other need of this propulſive cauſe.</p>

                  <hi>The manner of ordering Infants among the</hi> Peruvians, <hi>is worth the taking notice of; for there, the Children, both of the Nobles and Plebeians, are firſt waſhed in cold water, and in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner every day before they ſwathe them, neither do they untill the third month let them have their Armes at liberty, ſuppoſing that conduceth to their ſtrength; they lay them in woodden Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles upon nets inſtead of Beds, they never take them into their Armes or their Laps, no not when they give them ſuck, bur ſtooping down reach the Dug unto them, &amp; that only thrice eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day.

In the meane while he omits not the occaſion of crookedneſſe, that happens ſeldome to the Country people, but is much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to the Inhabitants of great Townes and Cities, which is by reaſon of the ſtraitneſſe and narrowneſſe of the garments that are worne by them; which is occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by the folly of Mothers, who while they covet to have their young Daughters bodies ſo ſmall in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle as may be poſsible, pluck and draw their bones awry, and make them crooked. For, the Ligaments of the Back-bone being very tender, ſoft and moiſt, at that age, cannot ſtay it ſtraite, and ſtrongly, but being pliant

And in another place, ſpeaking of diſlocations, or luxations, and the cauſes of Bunch-backs, and ſaddle-backs, and crooked<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſs, he ſaith, that fluid and ſoft bodies, ſuch as childrens, uſually are very ſubject to generate the internall cauſe of theſe miſchiefes, Defluxions: But if externall occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſhall concur with theſe internall cauſes, the Verte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra will ſooner be diſlocated. Thus Nurſes whilſt they too ſtreightly lace the Breaſts and ſides of Girles, ſo to make them ſlender, cauſe the Breaſt-bone to caſt it ſelfe forwards or backwards, or elſe the one ſhoulder to be bigger or fuller, the other more ſpare and leane: And if this happen in Infancy, the Ribt grow little or nothing in Breadth, but run outwards before, therefore the Cheſt loſeth its naturall Latitude, and ſtands out with a ſharpe point, hence they become Aſtmatick, the Lungs and Muſcles which ſerve for breathing being preſſed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and ſtreightned; and that they may the eaſier breathe, they are forced to hold up their heads, whence al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo they ſeeme to have great Throats, and their bodies uſe not to grow at the Spine, and the parts belonging to the Breaſt and Back become more ſlender; neither is it any wonder, for, ſeeing the Veines, Arteries, and Nerves are not in their places, the ſpirits do neither freely, nor the alimentary juyces plenteouſly flow by theſe ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned paſſages, whence leanneſſe muſt needs enſue. The the ſame errour is committed if they lay Children more frequently along upon their ſides than upon their backs, or if taking them up when they wake, they take them only by the feet or legs, and never put their other hand under their backs, never ſo much as thinking that Children grow moſt towards the Heads.

               <p>But as for the other part of their Queens ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, it no way ſtands with the honeſty of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; who the better to allure men from Sodomy, ordained that the women ſhould weare but three Cubits of cloath in their Smocks, which they weare with three braces, which is therefore ſo ſtreight that they cannot go but they muſt ſhew their ſecrets as 'twere aloft, and in their going they feigne to hide it with their hand, but cannot, by reaſon of the ſtraightneſſe of the cloath; for they are ſo covered (as another obſerves,<note place="margin">Herberts <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels.</hi>

                  <hi>Concerning the nature of the Menſtruall bloud, there hath been, and yet is, hard hold, and many opinions among Phyſicians.

So that the impurity of the Courſes is not ſo great as ſome would have it, the menſtruall bloud being only abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant in women, and hath no other fault at all in ſound bodies, and is but abuſively call'd an excrement.</hi>

Yet</hi> Mizaldus <hi>orders it to be cut long in Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male children, becauſe the Inſtruments of Generation follow the proportion of it; and therefore if it be cut too ſhort in a Female, it will be a hinderance to her ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of children.</hi> Taiſnier <hi>the famous Chiromancer and Aſtrologer affirmes the ſame thing.</hi>

But now it is to be enquired how in</hi> terminis naturalibus <hi>it can be done that women ſhould be turned into men, as the infinite examples of ſuch Caſes ſeeme to prove; which ſince it is monſtrous, we muſt have recourſe to the cauſes of Monſters, which happen by the errour of Nature, occaſioned, either through the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience of matter, or debility of the Agent, and therefore they properly and modeſtly enough define a Monſter to be a certaine</hi> oblaeſion <hi>of Nature. And that it is monſtrous for women to be turned into men, is apparent by</hi> Ariſtotles <hi>Definition; for that is mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous which is beſides Nature, to wit, that Nature which for the moſt part is; for beſides that which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies and neceſſary is, nothing is done, therefore Monstroſity happens when any thing beſides Nature appeares in thoſe things which for the most part are

                  <note place="margin">How women are turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men.</note> 
                  <hi>but may alſo be done otherwiſe: wherefore ſince it is againſt the order of Humane Nature, that a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhould degenerate into a man, yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it being not impoſſible, that we call monstrous, and it hath the ſame cauſe which other Monſters ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Quality, Number, Magnitude, or Scituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Members, wherefore for this reaſon the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned reduce the cauſe of this Humane Metamorphoſis to the errour of the virtue Agent, and the aptitude of ſuperfluous matter. If this happened while every Animall exiſted in Generation, it would cleare all doubts: But ſince it is done when the Animall is borne, how the virtue Formatrix can effect it, is not eaſie to explaine, but ſeemes a great Difficulty. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Anatomiſts and Phyſitians ſay, that the virile member in ſuch women was from the firſt, ingenite, the Agent virtue working on ſuperfluous matter that forme upon it, but by ſuch a Law of Nature that it cannot come forth untill ſuch a determinate time, which ought not to ſeeme impoſſible to any man, ſince we ſee in Embrions, even in the mothers wombe, Teeth formed, and yet lie hid until the appointed time of their extramiſſion; which is very true, and known by ocular Faith from the diſſections of Abortives and Infants new-born,</hi>

                  <hi>Men and women have the greateſt Feet in proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all Creatures, yet Females ordinarily in every kind have leſſe and ſlenderer feet than Males. Which Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of Nature, the affectation of theſe people, to their own diſadvantage, hath extended beyond her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. Man only by the advantage of the ſtraightneſſe of his Legs goeth upright, the proper uſe of the Foot being to walke, and the action is walking, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Foot is called</hi> Inſtrumentum ambulatorium, <hi>or a walking Inſtrument; this walking is, when one Leg reſteth upon the ground, and the other is brought about forward; the reſting is the action of the Foot, properly ſo called; the reach forward, the action of the Leg, and therefore an ambulation is made by ſtation and motion, that is, ſtanding, and proceeding, the Foot it ſelfe is the Inſtrument of the former, and the whole Leg of the latter. Now for aſſured, and conſtant, or firme ſtation, Man alone, (as he hath Palmes of his Hands) ſo he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath broad flat Soles to his Feet; and alſo for the accompliſhment of thoſe many motions whereof we ſtand in need, the ſtructure and figure of the Foot and Leg is

                  <hi>and the Toes are made long and broad, not ſo long as in the hands, but only as was neceſſary to faſten the feet when we would ſtrive to run. For if the Toes be preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed unto the ground, it is ſtrange with how much ſtrength and ſecurity the body is driven forward: for the Toes being bent, in the going are faſtened upon the ground as ſo many Anchors, and ſo commodiouſly transfer our bodies, not only upon plaine, but alſo upon aſcending and rugged places, as we may obſerve in thoſe who live upon mountaines, (our mountaines of</hi> Wales <hi>confirme this) where they go barefoot; from whence we may collect, ſaith</hi> Varolius, <hi>that ſhooes or any other induments of the Feet are beſides Nature, and very prejudiciall to the action of the Toes and Feet:</hi>

Some have wondred why man in Compariſon of other Creatures is endued with very great Feet, not conſidering that man, who only walketh upright, ſtood in need of two great Feet to ſusteine the weight of his body. But the great wonder is, that man upon ſo narrow ſoles of his feet ſhould be kept upright and not fall; it being tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admirable, that ſo vaste and erect a body, ſuſteined with two props, to wit, his Legs, whoſe baſis is ſo narrow, as the loweſt tranſverſe amplitude of the Foot doth make, that he ſhould not for all them ſlide and fall, but conſiſt upon them, as we ſee it happen in other things, which are no better ſuſteined than upon the ſmall baſis of two Feet; which inſooth would hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen alſo in the body, unleſſe by the benefit of Muſcles

We call thoſe ſmall feet, which if they be compared with the body unto which they appertaine, or to other of the ſame kind, and having the ſame bulke, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, and leſſe quantity of matter reſts in them than in others of the ſame ſpecies. For, that which failes in magnitude is called ſmall, as that which in multitude few: ſmall feet argue paucity of matter, and where, through this affected prohibition of growth, the matter of the Foot is leſſe then naturally it ought to be, the virtue that was ordained to be in that matter cannot be ſo vivid and effectuall; and if they by this Artifice be brought alſo to be narrowed in the ſoles, the parts muſt be more confuſed, and ſo not diſtinct, nor ſo well articulate, and have ſmall Toes, and there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares no foot-ſtep of bones or Tendons; which are more pleaſant to looke upon than ſerviceable to that office to which they were appointed, which although they may be accounted delicate, yet are not ſimply beautifull, having leſſe corporiety then is required to make the foot perfect according to Nature.

they who have ſtrictly enquired into the cauſe,<note place="margin">Enquity how ſo great a part of mankind became Black</note> have found no leſſe darkeneſſe in it, than blackneſs in the effect it ſelfe, there ariſing unto examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no ſuch ſatisfactory and unquarrellable rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as may confirme the cauſes generally recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, which are but two in number, that is, the heat and the ſcorch of the Sun, or the curſe of God on <hi>Cham</hi> and his Poſterity. That the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon imputation to the heat of the Sun in thoſe Climates is falſe, is approved by a moſt unanſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable argument; for, there are ſome Nations of this colour, although the Pole Antartique in that place be in the elevation of thirty and five degrees, which is a very ſtrange thing; yea, the rude people that live among the moſt cold Mountaines of the Moone are black alſo, as <hi>Pigafetta</hi> relates. That Neither of theſe is the cauſe, the learned Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer into vulgar Errours hath evinced, or at leaſt made dubious; yet how and when this tincture began it was yet a riddle unto him, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively to determine, it ſurpaſſed his preſumption: ſeeing therefore, ſaith he, we cannot certainly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover what did effect it, it may afford ſome piece of ſatisfaction to know what might procure it. It may therefore be conſidered, whether the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward uſe of certaine waters, or fountaines of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar operations, might not at firſt produce the effect,<note place="margin">Dr <hi>Brownes</hi> Pſeudodoxia E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidemica, lib. <hi>6.</hi> cap. <hi>10.</hi>
                  </note> ſince of the like we have records in Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Secondly, it may be propounded, whether it might not fall out the ſame way that <hi>Jacobs</hi> Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle became ſpeckled, ſpotted, and ring-ſtreaked, that is, by the power and efficacy of imagination, which produceth effects in the conception, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent

Thirdly, it is not undiſputable whether it might not proceed from ſuch a cauſe, and the like foundation of Tincture as doth the black-Jaundies, which meeting with congenerous cauſes, might ſettle durable inquinations, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance their generations unto that hue which was naturally before, but a degree or two below it. And this tranſmiſſion we ſhall the eaſier admit in colour, if we remember the like hath been effected in organicall parts or figures, the Symetry where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of being caſually, or purpoſely perverted, hath vigourouſly deſcended to their Poſterities, and that in durable deformities. This was the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>Macrocephali,</hi> or people with long heads. Thus have the <hi>Chineſes</hi> little feet, moſt <hi>Negroes</hi> great Lips, and flat-Noſes; and thus many Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, and Mediterranean Inhabitants, which are of the Race of <hi>Barbary-Moores</hi> (although after frequent commixture) have not worn out the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moyſe Noſe unto this day. To omit (therefore) the other conjectures of our ingenious Author, we ſhall take leave in the Tenour of his own words to ſay, that it may be the ſeed of <hi>Adam</hi> might firſt receive this tincture, and became black by an advenient and artificiall way of denigrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which at firſt was a meere affectation ariſing from ſome conceit they might have of the beauty of blackneſſe, and an Apiſh deſire which might move them to change the complexion of their
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:114623:263"/>
bodies into a new and more faſhionable hue,<note place="margin">Nations of a colour like Braſſe.</note> which will appeare ſomewhat more probable by divers affectations of painting in other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, mentioned in this Treatiſe; and that they take ſo much content therein, that they eſteeme deformity by other colours, deſcribing the Devill, and terrible objects white, for they thinke and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily perſwade themſelves that they are the right colour of men, and that we have a falſe and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit colour: And ſo from this Artifice the <hi>Moores</hi> might poſſibly become <hi>Negroes,</hi> receiving a tramentitious impreſſion, by the power and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of imagination. And this complexion, firſt by Art acquired, might be evidently maintained by generation, and by the tincture of the skin, as a ſpermaticall part traduced from Father to Son. For thus perhaps this which at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this Complexion was an artificiall device, and thence induced by imagination, having once impregnated the ſeed, found afterwards concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent productions, which were continued by Climes, whoſe conſtitution advantaged the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall into a naturall impreſſion.</p>

All other Creatures, if they have ſufficient and proper food, will grow fat and be franked, whereas men, although they have the beſt aliment exhibited to them, will not in like manner be fat, the chiefe cauſe whereof, as to man, is imputed to his temperament; but there are three cauſes found which impedes the

                  </note> the bodies that are leane and ſlender do better and more eaſily yield to Nature, which bringeth a better proportion and a forme to every member, and contrariwiſe it ſeemeth, theſe groſſe, corpulent, and over-fed bodies do encounter Nature, and be not ſo nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and pliant to her, by reaſon of their heavy ſubſtance. As we ſee it by experience; the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren which women bring before their time, and be ſomewhat caſt before they ſhould have been borne, be ſmaller and fairer alſo, and more pure, commonly, than other that go their time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the matter whereof the body is formed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more ſupple and pliant, is the eaſier weilded by Nature, which giveth them their ſhape and forme, the naturall cauſe of which effect he gives place to them, diſpute it who will, without far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deciding the ſame. And indeed, as <hi>Levinus Lemnius</hi> obſerves, it is confirmed by daily expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that children who do much Gormandize grow up leſſe comely, neither ſhoot up to a juſt and decent longitude; for the Native heat is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focated and over-whelmed with too much moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, that it cannot ſhape the body to a comely taleneſs of ſtature, wheras they who are fed mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately and uſe a ſparer diet, &amp; feed only at certain ſet times, become not very groſſe, neither increaſe in fleſh or grow fat, but their bones thereupon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in length. So we ſee young men &amp; children in long continued ſickneſſes to grow lean and ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, yet their bodies to ſhoot out in length, and to increaſe in ſtature, which <hi>Lemnius</hi> ſhould thinke happens by reaſon of drineſſe; for, the bones, ſince

they are dry,<note place="margin">Men growing Giants by a diſeaſe.</note> they are nouriſhed with an aliment familiar &amp; agreeable unto them, ſeeing that in ſick men the humours and aliment received, through heat and the drineſſe of the body become dry, the bones are extended in length, and by reaſon of the ſomewhat dry nouriſhment, they gaine ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in ſtature, eſpecially when man is in ſuch an age wherein his body (as ſoft and ductile Potters clay) may be formed and produced in length.

In like manner a ſon of <hi>Cornelius Tacitus,</hi> the Noble Hiſtorian, died young. Every man hath a certaine and determinate time ſet to his growth, wherein by degrees and tacite aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations he attaineth either to a legitimate or Dwarfiſh ſtature; and that power of encreaſing whereby the body happens to be enlarged in lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude, is ſeldome produced beyond the five and twentieth yeare, but for the greateſt part is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated within one and twenty yeares; but to grow fat, and corpulent, happens not to be done in certaine ſpaces of time, but by reaſon of nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when it is plentifully taken in, which may
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:114623:271"/>
be either in the achma or declination of our age; for although one be cram'd,<note place="margin">The cauſe of all ſtature.</note> his body is not erected in length, but is dilated in bulke and breadth; for, the faculty whereby the body is nouriſhed is one, and that whereby it groweth up is another; for truly that is converſant about the plenty of aliment, this, about the ſolid parts of the body, to wit, the Bones, Nerves, Cartila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which if they increaſe and are ſtretched out in length, the Creature alſo attaines unto an increment, although it be waſted with leaneneſſe and conſumed away. Therefore Nature in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the bones, whence the heighth of man proceeds, uſeth the force of hear, whereby ſhe not a little drieth the humours, and accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates the aliment for the nouriſhment of the Bones. Therefore it is the Amplifying force or Faculty which formeth out in length the bones of Febricitants as wax; by vertue and heat of the ſeminall excrement, which in the vigour of age is very valid and efficacious for the performance thereof: For truly, if young men and boyes are accuſtomed to milke from their very Cradles, and given to exerciſe, they will have taller bodies, and prove of a more decent and comely ſtature; becauſe by the drinking and uſe of milk, the bones are nouriſhed, which is a kin to ſeed, and an ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate and exactly concocted bloud.

But let us heare what the Oracle of Humane Learning ſaith to this purpoſe:<note place="margin">Lord <hi>Bacons</hi> nat. hiſt. cent. <hi>5.</hi>
                  </note> To accelerate growth or ſtature, it muſt proceed, either from the plenty of the nouriſhment, or from the quickning and exciting of the naturall heat; for the firſt, exceſſe of nouriſhment is hurtfull, for it maketh the child corpulent, and growing in breadth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than height. And you may make an experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from plants, which if they ſpread much are ſeldome tall. As for the nature of nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, firſt, it may not be too dry: And therefore Children in Dary Countries do wax more tall than where they feed more upon bread and fleſh. There is alſo a received Tale, that boyling of dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie roots in milke (which it is certaine are great driers) will make dogs little. But ſo much is true, that an over-drie nouriſhment in Children put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth

back ſtature. Secondly,<note place="margin">Meanes of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> the nouriſhment muſt be of an opening nature; for, that attenuateth the juyce, and furthereth the motion of the ſpirits upwards; neither is it without cauſe, that <hi>Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon</hi> in the nourture of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Children doth ſo much commend their feeding upon <hi>Cardamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum,</hi> which (he ſaith) made them grow better, and be of a more active habit. <hi>Cardamomum</hi> in Latine is, <hi>Naſturtium,</hi> and with us water-creſſes, which it is certaine is an herbe, that, whileſt it is young, is friendly to life. As for the quickning of naturall heat, it muſt be done chiefly by exerciſe. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (no doubt) much going to ſchoole, where they ſit ſo much, hindreth the growth of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, whereas Country people, that go not to Schoole, are commonly of better ſtature. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, men muſt beware how they give Children any thing that is cold in operation, for even long ſucking doth hinder both wit and ſtature; this hath been tried, that a whelpe that hath been fed with Nitre in milk, hath become very little, but extreame lively; for, the ſpirit of Nitre is cold. And although it be an excellent medicine in ſtrength of yeares for prolongation of life, yet it is in children and young creatures an enemy to growth, and all for the ſame reaſon; for, heat is requiſite to growth, but after a man is come to his middle age, heat conſumeth the ſpirits, which the coldneſſe of the ſpirit of Nitre doth help to condenſe and correct.</p>

By this account he will be a tall man who is ſeven foot (or ſomewhat leſſe) in length, and in breadth and thickneſſe is moſt conformable to a proportioned body; on the contrary, he is a little or low man whoſe length fals ſhort of ſix foot, in the other Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions

               <p>The Story of a nation of Pigmies is not a meer Fable; and although ſome make a ſmall account of them, yet they ought not ſo to be deſpiſed, as to be paſſed over inviſibly; certainly, ſcarce in any narration of humane monſters, ancient Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters do more conſpire, and ſeriouſly declare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; nay, even <hi>Philoſtratus,</hi> who out of <hi>Apolloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> ſaies, all other Monſters of men are fabulous; he excepts Pigmies, affirming that they live, and that the Relation is not vaine.

The forme of the beaſt occupieth ſome place in the aire, and ſo I think ſhould the forme of a man do alſo; for, to bring the body of a man, without feeling, into ſuch a thin airy Nature, as that it can neither be ſeene nor felt, it may well be unlikely; for it is very unpoſſible, for the aire is unconſtant, and continueth not in one place, ſo as this aiery Creature would ſoone be carried into another Region. But indeed, our bodies are viſible, ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and paſſive, and are endued with many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent properties, which all the Devils in Hell are not able to alter; neither can one haire of our head periſh, or fall away, or be transformed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſpeciall providence of God Almighty. Another Queſtion is put, whether that man was an Aſſe all the while, or that Aſſe a man? <hi>Bodin</hi> ſaith (his reaſon only reſerved) he is truly tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiated into an Aſſe, ſo as there is no part of a man but reaſon, remaining in that Aſſe.

their roome,<note place="margin">The Leger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demaine of Changlings.</note> which have been deformed Innocents, which we commonly call Changlings; the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of <hi>Religio Medici</hi> confeſſeth, that of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions wherewith the Devill abuſeth man, he is moſt puzled with the Legerdemaine of Chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings. This power the Devill hath to put Chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings in the place of other Children, one brings as an argument to prove that he or his inſtruments can transfer and transforme themſelves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: Yet a learned Divine of ours thinkes a Changling is not one Child changed for another, but one Child on a ſudden much changed from it ſelfe. Howbeit, I find that <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes Conjurations againſt the Changlings. Whether the Devill may have a power of ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, transferring, ſubborning, or putting one in the place of another, and of Changling Infants, needs not much be queſtioned, for that ſometimes ſome ſuch thing is done, is not by his power, but by the permiſſion of God for the ſins of men, as the Learned hold; eſpecially, when wicked Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, neglecting all religious care of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, do not arme them with godly Benedictions, but overwhelme them with Demoniacall execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; All men therefore may learn hence, to order their Children religiouſly, and to conſecrate them to God, and not to caſt them away by Demoniacall maledictions.</p>

               <hi>AN APPENDIX,</hi> Exhibiting the Pedigree of the <hi>Engliſh Gallant.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Pon the Relation of this intended Practicall <hi>Metamorphoſis,</hi> I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that all men thought me to be neceſſarily ingaged to touch upon the transformation and deformity of Apparell; the thing offering it ſelfe lo naturally, every Scene almoſt affording ſome emergent occaſion or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for ſuch a Diſcourſe. Which conceit, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, I had admitted, but that I deſired to keep cloſe to my proper Argument. A little therefore to anſwer expectation, I thought good to annex this Appendix, wherein I ſhall a little explaine this Proverbe, <hi>God makes and the Tailor ſhapes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Freely to deliver my opinion of this vanity of Apparell, I conceive it to be the ſame itch, and the ſame ſpirit of Contradiction and Phantaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calneſſe working in the Children of vanity, and the ſame abuſe put upon Nature; only <hi>à tergo,</hi>
               <pb n="530" facs="tcp:114623:294"/>
being a kind of back-biting mockery, proceeding from mans petulant wit and invention. Neither do I thinke it difficult, out of the preceding Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe to produce a pedigree of our Engliſh Gallants; The deſigne being the ſame in both, to wit, to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to ground a perſwaſion in others that they are ſo ſhaped by Nature, as they would appeare; although their affected ſhapes makes them ſeeme far from that they really are. And I think it were not impoſſible to prove, that there was never any conceit ſo extravagant, that ever forced the Rules of Nature; or Faſhion ſo mad, which fell into the imaginations of any of theſe indited Nations, that may not meet with ſome publike Faſhion of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell among us, and ſeeme to be grounded upon the ſame pretended reaſon. Hence ſpring thoſe Faſhions that are in Credit among us; and what is out of Faſhion is out of the compaſſe of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as we (God knows how for the moſt part unreaſonable) judge. And verily one might wonder that at ſuch diſtance of time and place there ſhould be a ſympathy, ſimilitude, correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency and jumpings of ſo many wild and popular opinions in this matter of Extravagancy which no way ſeeme to hold with our naturall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; and therefore the worſer vices, becauſe they ſhock our naturall knowledge, and give ſuch a blow to the ordinary fortiſhneſſe of our judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>I pray, what were our Suger-loafe Hats ſo mightily affected of late both by men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ſo incommodious for uſe, that every puffe of wind deprived us of them, requiring the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:114623:294"/>
of one hand to keep them on? Was it not the ſame conceit that the <hi>Macrones</hi> of <hi>Pontus,</hi> and the <hi>Macrocephali</hi> once had, among whom they were eſteemed the beſt Gentlemen who had the higheſt head? So our Gallants (then) to be diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the Vulger head, choſe, for a token of their Nobility, to have ſugar-loafe-like Hats; inſomuch as he was no Gentleman then who had not ſuch a Hat, it being the ſame affectation; and ſurely ſome of the moſt affected of them could have been content to have altered the very mould or block of their Head, had they had patience or time to do it, or could they have thought the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion would have laſted ſo long, that it had been worth the corrupting of Midwives and Nurſes to contribute their aſſiſtance unto the worke.</p>

after (as lately) we came to weare them ſo long waſted, yea, almoſt ſo low as our Privities, then began we to condemn the former faſhion as fond, intollerable, and deformed, and to commend the later as comely, handſome, and commendable. A kind of madneſſe or ſelfe-fond humour that giddieth (as one ſaith) our underſtandings, ſo new fangled and ſudden, that all the Tailors in the world cannot invent Novelties ſufficient; one ſelfe-ſame judgement, in the ſpace of fifteene or twenty yeares, admitting not only two or three different, but alſo cleane contrary opinions, with ſo light and incredible conſtancy, that any man would wonder at it. The waſte (as one notes) is now come to the knee; for, the Points that were uſed to be about the middle, are now dangling there, and now more lately the waſte is deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded down towards the Ankles.</p>

Yet he bewailes the particular indiſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that men ſuffer themſelves to be blinded, as to be deceived by the Authority of preſent Cuſtome, and that if Cuſtome pleaſeth, he is ready to change opinion, and vary advice, every month, nay, every day, and judgeth ſo diverſly of himſelfe. And ſo remarkably uncertaine and giddy-headed herein are we, that whereas all grave Nations are conſtant to their habits, and may be deſcribed by them, they uſe to paint an Engliſh man naked, with

And although theſe are but ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall faults, yet they are of evill preſages, and we are warned that the maine ſummers of our hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes faile and ſhrinke, when we ſee the Quarters bend, or walls to breake. <hi>Plato</hi> in his Lawes, thinkes there is no worſe plague, or more perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in his City, than to ſuffer youth to have the reines of Liberty in their own hand, to change in their attires from one forme unto another, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving the judgement, now to this, now to that place, following new fangled devices, and regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their Inventours. <hi>Ariſtippus</hi> (indeed) being of a contrary complexion to <hi>Plato,</hi> thought, that no Garment could corrupt a chaſte mind. But all Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Nations have juſtly thought this ſpreading miſchiefe, when it grew high, worth the reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: the prodigious and ridiculous vanity of theſe times (if ever) calling for ſumptuary Laws to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the Apiſh Fantaſticalneſſe of apparell, in the luxurious uſe whereof men ſeeme neither to underſtand the times, themſelves, nor others. The Mode being now held the only thing of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence our Gallants fixe their judgements upon; for, they note the Garbe and Demeanour of men; they view his Boots, and his Hat, and according as it complies, or failes in conformity to theirs, ſo they marke and pronounce what manner of man

            <p>To conclude, touching theſe indifferent things, as cloaths and garments, whoſoever will reduce them to their true end, muſt fit them to the ſervice and commodity of the body, whence dependeth their originall grace and comlineſſe, which can no way better be done then by cutting them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the naturall ſhape and proportion of the body, as we may probably imagine the skin-gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were, wherewith the Lord God, who beſt knew their ſhape, firſt cloathed the nakedneſſe of our firſt Parents. What uſe is there of any then Arming ſleeves, which anſwer the proportion of the arme? Or to what end are our breeches as wide at the knee as the whole circumference of the waſte? Or, why ſo long, do they make men Duck-leg'd? Or, why ſo ſtrained outwith an intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable

It is a wonderfull teſtimony of the imbecillity of our judgements, that when we have hit of a convenient faſhion we cannot keep to it, but we muſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend and allow of Faſhions for the rareneſſe or novelty, though neither goodneſſe nor profit be joyned to them.</p>
